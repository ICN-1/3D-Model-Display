# 3D Display App with Flutter and Flutter3DController

This Flutter project demonstrates the loading, interaction, and animation of 3D assets (specifically `.glb` files) using the `flutter_3d_controller` package. The app supports mobile and desktop platforms and features user interaction through swipe and button gestures, as well as on-screen or keyboard controls to manipulate 3D objects. It allows users to upload their own `.glb` files and view animated 3D models with a customizable avatar system.

## Features

- **Load 3D Assets**: The app allows users to load and display `.glb` 3D assets on both mobile and desktop platforms.
- **Interactive Animations**: The app includes basic animations that can be triggered by user actions, including predefined animations from the Ready Player Me Animation Library.
